## 🔐 Authentication

ClubSphere uses **Firebase Authentication** for client-side authentication and **JWT tokens** for backend authorization. The platform supports:

- **Email/Password authentication** - Traditional email and password login
- **Google Sign-In** - OAuth-based Google authentication
- **Role-based access control (RBAC)** - Three distinct roles:
  - **Admin**: Full system access and management
  - **Club Manager**: Club and event management
  - **Member**: Club discovery and event participation

### Authentication Flow

1. User authenticates with Firebase (email/password or Google OAuth)
2. Frontend receives Firebase ID token
3. ID token is sent to backend API for verification
4. Backend returns JWT token for API authorization
5. JWT token is stored in localStorage and included in API requests
6. Protected routes check authentication state via `AuthContext`

Authentication state is managed through React Context (`AuthContext`) and protected routes ensure users have appropriate permissions. The `PrivateRoute` component handles route protection based on user roles.

## 💳 Payment Integration

The application integrates with **Stripe** for secure payment processing:

- **Club membership payments** - One-time or recurring membership fees
- **Event registration fees** - Payment for event tickets/registrations
- **Payment success/cancel handling** - User feedback and confirmation pages
- **Payment history tracking** - Complete transaction history for all users

### Payment Flow

1. User initiates payment (club membership or event registration)
2. Frontend creates payment intent via backend API
3. Stripe Elements securely collect card information
4. Payment is processed through Stripe
5. Backend webhook confirms payment completion
6. User receives confirmation and access is granted

**Security**: Stripe Elements handle all sensitive card data, ensuring PCI compliance. Card information never touches our servers.

## 🚢 Deployment

### Firebase Hosting

The application is deployed on **Firebase Hosting**. The backend API is deployed separately on **Vercel**.

#### Prerequisites

- **Firebase CLI** installed globally:
  ```bash
  npm install -g firebase-tools
  ```

- **Firebase project** initialized:
  ```bash
  firebase login
  firebase init hosting
  ```

#### Deployment Steps

1. **Build the application**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   This creates an optimized production build in the `dist/` directory.

2. **Deploy to Firebase Hosting**
   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only hosting
   ```
   
   Or deploy everything:
   ```bash
   firebase deploy
   ```

3. **Verify deployment**
   - Visit your Firebase Hosting URL (e.g., `https://clubsphere-c7f59.web.app`)
   - Check the Firebase Console: https://console.firebase.google.com/

#### Firebase Configuration

The project uses the following Firebase configuration files:
- `firebase.json` - Firebase hosting and functions configuration
- `.firebaserc` - Firebase project settings

#### Environment Variables

For local development, create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://clubsphere-backend.vercel.app
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_firebase_auth_domain
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_firebase_project_id
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_firebase_storage_bucket
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_firebase_messaging_sender_id
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_firebase_app_id
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_stripe_publishable_key
```

**Note**: For production deployment, environment variables should be set in your build environment or CI/CD pipeline. Vite requires the `VITE_` prefix for environment variables to be exposed to the client-side code.

#### Deployment Architecture

```
┌─────────────────────┐
│   Firebase Hosting  │  ← Frontend (Static Files)
│  (clubsphere-c7f59) │
│   .web.app domain   │
└──────────┬──────────┘
           │
           │ API Requests
           ▼
┌─────────────────────┐
│   Vercel Backend    │  ← Backend API (Express.js)
│ (clubsphere-backend)│
│   .vercel.app       │
└─────────────────────┘
```

The frontend makes API requests to the Vercel backend using the `VITE_API_BASE_URL` environment variable.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Build Errors

**Issue**: Build fails with module not found errors
- **Solution**: Delete `node_modules` and `package-lock.json`, then run `npm install` again

**Issue**: Vite build warnings about large chunks
- **Solution**: This is a warning, not an error. Consider code splitting for optimization, but the build will still work

#### Deployment Issues

**Issue**: `firebase: command not found`
- **Solution**: Install Firebase CLI globally: `npm install -g firebase-tools`

**Issue**: Firebase deployment fails with authentication error
- **Solution**: Run `firebase login` to authenticate

**Issue**: Environment variables not working in production
- **Solution**: Ensure all variables are prefixed with `VITE_` and rebuild the application

#### API Connection Issues

**Issue**: API requests failing with CORS errors
- **Solution**: Verify the backend CORS configuration includes your Firebase Hosting URL

**Issue**: API requests returning 401 Unauthorized
- **Solution**: Check that the JWT token is being sent in the Authorization header. Clear localStorage and re-authenticate.

#### Development Server Issues

**Issue**: Port 5173 already in use
- **Solution**: Vite will automatically use the next available port, or specify a port: `npm run dev -- --port 3000`

**Issue**: Hot Module Replacement (HMR) not working
- **Solution**: Clear browser cache or try a hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
